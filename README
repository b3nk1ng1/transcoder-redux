This is the Transcoder Redux project. Formerly known as Visual Hub and iSquint, now it's called FilmRedux and PunyVid.

Keep your eyes peeled, as we turn this project into what it should have been.

INSTALL NOTES

On a fresh Leopard install, Growl and libfaac needed to be installed, in order to get this to compile correctly.

Growl: http://growl.info/ Just click and install. Pretty easy.
libfaac: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/faac/faac-1.26.tar.gz Download this to a directory, unzip it, and run './bootstrap && ./configure && make && sudo make install' to compile it. See the INSTALL file for more info.

After these two programs are installed, FilmRedux should run, and be able to do any of the Apple formats correctly.

Please send me any sort of problems. I love bug reports, and I'd be happy to get these programs up and running on your system.

Thanks!
